# Tidy Tuesday Week 37, 2024: College Attendance by Parental Income and Tier üéì
This week, I explored data on U.S. college attendance rates from Opportunity Insights, focusing on how parental income affects the likelihood of attending selective colleges. Below are two visualizations that highlight key trends:

## 1Ô∏è Heatmap of Weighted College Attendance Rates by Parental Income and College Tier
The heatmap shows the distribution of college attendance rates across different income groups and college tiers.
### Key Insight: 
Wealthier students tend to have higher attendance rates in selective colleges (higher tiers). However, this trend is not consistent across all tiers, indicating disparities in access to education.

Data Source: Opportunity Insights, College Level Data for Selective American Colleges.

## 2Ô∏è Bar Plot of Unweighted Attendance Rates by Parental Income and College Tier
This bar plot breaks down the unweighted attendance rates by parental income group, across various college tiers.
### Key Insight: 
Higher proportions of students from wealthier backgrounds attend selective colleges, but there are variations across different tiers.
The facet wrap allows us to compare attendance rates across different tiers more clearly.

## Takeaways:

Both visualizations highlight a clear trend where wealthier students are more likely to attend selective colleges.
The data raises important questions about accessibility and equality in higher education.
Let me know what you think of these findings!
